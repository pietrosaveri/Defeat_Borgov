# Interactive Story Game
---
### Overview

This Python project is an interactive text-based story where the user takes control of the narrative by making key decisions throughout the game. The story evolves based on the choices the player makes, leading to different outcomes and experiences. This was one of my **first projects**, designed to explore branching narratives and player-driven storytelling.

At the start of the game, players can choose their character and select a weapon, both of which influence the progression of the story. The game is designed to be highly replayable, as different decisions lead to new story paths and endings.

### Features

- **Character selection:** Players choose from different characters, each with unique traits that affect the story.
- **Weapon selection:** Players pick a weapon, which impacts the course of events in certain situations.
- **Multiple story paths:** The narrative branches at key decision points, allowing for a unique experience each time.
- **Text-based adventure:** The game is entirely text-based, relying on player imagination and decision-making to drive the story.
